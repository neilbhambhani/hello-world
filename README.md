hello world!

Hi friends,

I stopped coding two years ago to learn about the world and figure out how I can make a difference. Now that I have a better handle on the historical and political context of the society I find myself in, I have returned to reaquire the skills I have atrophied and use them to help all sentient beings free themselves from suffering and create a society of Buddhas.

Peace
